This section will help you to install Spatial Design System library. Before that ensure you have already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm (included in Node.js).

## Prepare project

Our library is prepared to be run in a modern JavaScript environment like Webpack or Vite.
If you don't have an existing project, you can create a new one using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

This will prompt you with some questions about your project. Name your project, choose **Vanilla** (or **Vue.js** if you prefer) as a framework and select **JavaScript** as a variant.

::: tip Note
We will demonstrate library features in both vanilla JavaScript (no framework) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), but feel free to use any other framework you prefer.

## Install the package

Navigate to the project folder and add Spatial Design System library:

```bash
npm install spatial-design-system
```
